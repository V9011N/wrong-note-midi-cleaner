"""Estimate how likely a human-played MIDI is a performance of a given perfect MIDI.

The two files live on different clocks (the perfect source has its own tempo map, the
human one is played with rubato), so nothing here compares raw timestamps:

  1. `alignment.align` recovers the tempo warp between the files (coarse, then fine). It
     tolerates skipped and repeated sections by aligning in several segments.
  2. Every perfect note is pushed through the warp and we look for the same pitch in the
     human file near that time, and the reverse. Agreement is corrected for chance by
     repeating the test with the alignment deliberately knocked off by seconds.
  3. The evidence is blended into one 0..1 confidence about *identity* (is this the same
     piece?). *Coverage* (how much of the source the human plays) is reported separately,
     so a partial take is a weaker-coverage match, not a mismatch.

Velocities, durations and pedal are deliberately ignored: they are what a human adds,
not what identifies the piece.
