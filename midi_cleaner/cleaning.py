"""Plan and apply note-level cleaning of a human MIDI against its perfect source.

Only two kinds of edit exist: *remove* a human note the source doesn't contain, and *add* a
note the source has but the human file lacks. Nothing else is touched: velocities, timing,
pedal and every other event of the original file are written back exactly as recorded.

Safeguards, because the aim is to fix mistakes without damaging the performance:
  * notes are matched one-to-one, per aligned segment, by pitch and warped time;
  * a leftover human note and a leftover source note of the same pitch that are fairly close
    are one *displaced* note (timing, not a wrong note) and are left alone;
  * nothing is edited where the local alignment is poorly supported, near the joins between
    aligned segments, or in stretches the human skipped;
  * a leftover note that re-strikes a key the score says is still held (a double-played note) is
    removed, but the note it duplicates inherits its release, so the hold isn't cut short.
